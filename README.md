# C# Bitmap images and QR codes editing
 Second year academic project in C# including image manipulation and processing in Bitmap format, and the creation of QR codes containing text or a URL.

## Summary

This project was a second grade assignment that involved manipulating and editing images in Bitmap format as well as reading and writing QR codes storing text.

## Examples

### QR Code reading

As a personal innovation for this project, I chose to make QR code reading possible from a Bitmap image, even if it is distorted. A QR code flattened horizontally or vertically and containing white borders of any size can be read.

So, here is an example of a QR code readable by the program:
